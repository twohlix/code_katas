---------------------
First problem was getting Test::Unit to run, but google helped there. Never have run it independent of rails.
Second proble was getting my syntax for ruby right. I'm bad at ruby I'm finding. It's not natural yet.
Third problem was my initial sillyness made me think indices would somehow be preserved after a slice! Silly me.
Third problem was the major problem. I should slow down and think about the algo more before diving in. I think it works.
I'm going to add timing to this.
